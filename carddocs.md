# The Blox Cards Documentation

The General Card Effect Syntax
General case (single effect):

Effect = {
	Name
	Description
	Type
	Archetype
	Power
	Target
	Increase
}

The game executes the single effect as you would expect.

Sub-Effect case (multiple effects):

Effect = {
	Name
	Description
	Type
	Archetype
	Power = {
		{Power2, Increase2, Target2}
	}
	Target1
	Increase1
}

In the event of subeffects, game will first look for a secondary
target or increase. Should it not be able to find such secondary
values, it will fall back to the primary one. Should there be no
primary one but the effect does require it, the game crashes.
Make sure all effects get the info they need to function.

For example, the following effect uses Target1 for its subeffect.
Effect = {
	Power = {
		{Power2, Increase2}
	}
	Target1
	Increase1
}

This one uses Target2 but Increase1 for its subeffect.
Effect = {
	Power = {
		{Power2, nil, Target2}
	}
	Target1
	Increase1
}

Some terms, "glossary"

- Fatique
Whenever a player needs to draw a card but cannot because there are
no cards left in his deck, the player receives damage.

- Grinding
Whenever a player needs to draw a card but cannot because his hand
is full, the cards are removed from his deck but aren't added to his
hand.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Card Properties
Card properties do not affect gameplay but instead describe what a
card is.

- Original
When a card is a cosmetic variation of another, this property
should be the index of the original card it inherits its gameplay
attributes from. Both cards should be complete and should function
identically.

- AltArt
When set to true, the card will appear in the minigames and be
disqualified from auctions. It will be treated as a special cosmetic
card.

- AltCards
This is a table of a card's alternate cards.
Alternate cards first check their own table for data, then the table
of their Original card. This way, anything can be optionally
customized, including Effect properties.

For example, the following tables form a valid alt card system:
["CardOne"] = {
	AltCards = {
		["CardOne-Artv"] = {
			Id = 261432099;
			AltArt = true;
			Bio = "Part of the Aife collection!";
		};
		["CardOne Halloween"] = {
			Id = 461436099;
			Effect = {
				Name = "Spooky help";
				Description = "Summon a spooky thing.";
				Power = {{"Summon","Spooky Thing"}};
			}
			Bio = "Boo!";
		}
	}
	Effect = {
		Name = "Call for help"
		Description = "Summon a thing.";
		Power = {{"Summon", "Thing"}}
		Target = "Ally";
	}
};


In this example, CardOne is the Original card.
CardOne-Artv is an Alternate Art card. It has its own image Id
and Bio. CardOne Halloween is special because its effect was modified:
it has a custom name, description and power for its effect,
as well as a unique image Id and card Bio.
